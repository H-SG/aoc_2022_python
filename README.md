# aoc_2022_python
Back for another year babey!

Last year I did rust, which while a lot of fun was a bit hard when I started running into the limits of my algo knowledge.

As such, this year the learning forcus for me is on  algos, and I will be sticking with the comfortingly familiar Python.

As usual, my IDE de jour will be VS Code on WSL and using lots of typing.

## Day 1
I almost completely forgot about day 1. The whole week I've been harking on about doing this, and almost catastrophy.

I'm not going to write too many functions yet, I'l; start abstracting things out once I've figured out what happens the mostest. For now, please accept this very naive implementation.

## Day 2
Doing this on day 3, because I'M A REBEL. Looks like list, splits, and some pattern matching. Bish bash bosh.

I think this could go quicker with nested matching, but since there are only 9 possible options it didn't take too long to sort out.

## Day 3
String manipulations for dayz, honestly I don't do much string manipulation day to day, but using intersection in sets is something novel for me.
